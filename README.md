# About
***Uralics of Russia*** is a project dedicated to indigenous peoples of modern Russia and their languages.
Weâ€™re based mostly on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VBtmEDC9Yv ), though we also have a [VK page](https://vk.com/uralicsofrussia).

### What do we do?:
- Collecting, analysing and creating materials
- Learning *and speaking* the languages
