# Sami languages
Being the closest to Finnic languages, Sami language group consists of two branches:
- **Western** (South, Ume, Pite, Lule and Northern Sami)
- **Eastern** (Inari, Skolt, Akkala, Kildin and Ter Sami)
Only four of Eastern Sami languages starting with Skolt are located in Russia and thus covered by our server.
