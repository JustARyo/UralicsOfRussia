Being the closest to Finnic languages, Sami language group consists of two branches:
- **Western** (South, Ume, Pite, Lule and Northern Sami)
- **Eastern** (Inari, Skolt, Akkala, Kildin and Ter Sami)
Only four of Eastern Sami languages starting with Skolt are located in Russia and thus covered by our server.

## Akkala Sami
Akkala Sami is almost extinct Sami language of Kola Peninsula spoken near Imandra lake. It's poorly documented, but enough to make teaching materials for those 80 ethnic Akkala Samis, who are currently living in Yona village.

## Ter Sami
The easternmost Sami language spoken by only 2 people. However, there are ethnic Ter Sami who’re still hoping to learn their mother tongue. We have a decent-written wordbook from T. Itkonen and grammar from Tereshkin, and also one poem book from Ter Sami speaker Oktyabrina Voronova.
